 Based on the work of [Timo](https://github.com/ttlappalainen#:~:text=Timo%20Lappalainen,ttlappalainen)
 whos library i have used for some time now: Thanks Timo\
 Inspired by Hans [Hans](https://github.com/htool#:~:text=Hans,htool), whos ESP Compas i have used for some time, until buying a second hand NAC-2 including an original Precision-9  
 The work on my pilot controller would have been difficult without [Hans](https://github.com/htool#:~:text=RaymarineAPtoFakeNavicoAutoPilot)  
 I also like to thank the folks on [Canboat](https://canboat.github.io/canboat/canboat.html#lookup-MANUFACTURER_CODE:~:text=%C3%97-,Top,-PGN%20list)
